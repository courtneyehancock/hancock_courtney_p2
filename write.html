        <h3>Helmet World Record</h3>
          <h4>Published to the Independent Florida Alligator on November 26, 2017</h4>

          <p>UF students and Gator fans will attempt to break the world record of the largest gathering of people wearing helmets at the Gators men’s basketball game Today, International Guinness World Records Day, to promote scooter and bicycling safety on campus.</p>

          <p>The number to beat is 3,929.</p>
          <p>The game will be against the University of North Florida at the Exactech Arena at Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Start time is 7 p.m.</p>
          <p>The official attempt to break the record will be right before tipoff, after an announcement that will ask all fans to put on their helmets for five minutes.</p>
          <p>Breaking a world record is just a fun promotion that will hopefully catch the attention of the student body, according to Assistant Athletic Director of Marketing & Promotions Alicia Longworth, adviser to the Rowdy Reptiles, the men’s basketball student group.</p>
          <p>Longworth assisted in the execution process of the promotion. She said they have partnered with Florida Pedestrian and Bicycling Safety Resource Center who has provided 1,000 helmets that will be given out to students at Gate 3.</p>
          <p>They will be giving a scooter to one lucky student, she said, as well as giving away 10 Gator helmets.</p>
          <p>All fans attending the game are encouraged to bring their own helmet.</p>
          <p>Stephen Glancy, a senior UAA marketing intern and Rowdy Reptile, came up with the idea to bring attention to scooter and bike safety, as it is huge for the UF campus and Gainesville community.</p>
          <p>“It was really the perfect record for UF with scooters and bikes being so popular and the issue of students not wearing helmets being so prevalent,” he said.</p>
          <p>The actual world record attempt itself had to get approved after applying on the website, he said.</p>
          <p>“There will be two independent witnesses overseeing the attempt and the counting process,” he said. “There will be one steward for every 50 people to confirm their participation in the attempt.”</p>
          <p>Leading up to the game there will be videos sent out from the official team account promoting the event and scooter and bike safety, as well as a PSA from Gainesville PD, he said.</p>
          <p>The original record was achieved by Ministry of Interior at Baniyas stadium, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Mar. 13, 2016, according to the Guinness World Records website.</p>
          <p>UFPD Officer John Savona assisted in the process by helping the UAA Marketing Department get in touch with New Scooters 4 Less, which UFPD has partnered up with to promote scooter safety.</p>
          <p>Savona will be assisting the Florida Pedestrian and Bicycling Safety Resource Center to fit helmets today, he said.</p>
          <p>“The issue is very important to me because when riders are not wearing a helmet, whether it be on a bike or a scooter, and they get into an accident, usually the outcome is not good,” he said.</p>
          <p>Students are aware of what a helmet can do to protect them, but until something happens to them it isn’t reality, he said. That’s the problem with a lot of these scooter riders; they have helmets, but don’t wear them.</p>
          <p>Savona said he believes this event will help continue to remind students of the importance of wearing helmets and scooter and bicycling safety.</p>
          <p>“I would hope that they receive the message of the importance of helmet safety and encourage each other to wear them.”</p>

          <h3>The Power of Positivity</h3>
          <h4>Published to varsity.com in the summer of 2017</h4>
          <p>"Positive thinking is more than just a tagline. It changes the way we behave. And I firmly believe that when I am positive, it not only makes me better, but it also makes those around me better.” - Harvey Mackay</p>

          <p>Is the glass always half full? Is there always a brighter side to every situation? Does every cloud really have a silver lining? The power of positivity in the way you look at yourself, the way others look at you and the way you talk to others can aid your path to becoming a better dancer, better teammate and better you</p>

          <h4>The Way You Look At Yourself (Self Talk) –</h4>

          <p>“Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.” – Helen Keller</p>
          <p>Body image has become an extreme focus for young women, particularly in the dance world; self-talk is an extension of body image that deserves a heavy dose of attention. You are with you all the time: be kind.</p>
          <p>As a dancer, comparison is normal. How else do you become the best? Compare yourself with the best, try to reach that level and exceed it. The tricky part is going about it the right way—you have to look at your own strengths, because if you continually tell yourself that “she’s better than me” or “I’ll never be that good,” then you’re always going to be living that lie. Compare yourself to your prior self—can you be better when you leave than when you walked into practice? Can you focus on something that you want to improve on for that moment? </p>
          <p>If you tell yourself, “I can’t do it,” you’re not going to be able to. But if you tell yourself that you can, then you will. It’s all psychological—even if you have to lie to yourself the first couple of times, the repetitive nature will become an internal motivation that drives you to become what you know you can be. This works the same with the endurance of a routine. Come Nationals time, if you continue to tell yourself you can do it, that you’re going to hit the turns and do the best leap you’ve ever done, it increases the likelihood of you doing just that.</p>
          <p>Keep your self-talk positive, and you will never feel the negative.</p>
          <h4>The Way You Look (Positive Body Language) –</h4>
          <p>“In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision.” - Dalai Lama</p>
          <p>Everyone has heard the phrase, “practice makes perfect.” These three words have been coached, taught and preached time and time again to athletes, students and kids alike, hoping to embed the thought that practice is important and essential in future achievements and success. Although the “practice makes perfect” motto continues to inspire, my parents always taught me that specifics are a necessary part of understanding anything in life. They clarified that practice doesn’t only make perfect, but perfect practice makes perfect performance. You can practice until you’re blue in the face, but if you aren’t practicing the right way, you might as well go home.</p>
          <p>When it comes to being a member of a dance team, perfect practice can range from the simplicity of the way you stand to the complexity of hitting 110% every time you perform a skill. The way you stand in practice can set the tone for how people perceive you. Crossing your arms and yawning can not only make you feel more tired, but also make everyone around you feel more tired. Standing at attention, making eye contact and smiling, even if you’re pretending, can help set a tone for a better practice and make everyone feel better because of it.</p>
          <p>You have to practice the way you want to perform. As soon as you step into practice, your body should be performing all the time. If you constantly think, “Oh, it’s time to stand,” or “I guess it’s time to do this full out,” then it will never become muscle memory—It will always remain active memory instead of automatic. Professional ballet dancers walk into a dance studio and immediately stand the way they should: shoulders down, core tight, neck long, smiles on – This attitude and control of your port de bras doesn’t just reflect your performance as a dancer in practice, but also how others in practice will work off your energy. There might be times that you walk into practice and maybe 10% of your teammates aren’t having a good day, and its already showing in their bodies. But your focus on that type of work ethic may give them a positive model to follow, helping create a better atmosphere for a more beneficial and motivational practice.</p>
          <h4>The Way You Talk To Others (Positive External Language) --</h4>

          <p>"In every day, there are 1,440 minutes. That means we have 1,440 daily opportunities to make a positive impact.” – Les Brown<p>
          <p>Within our lifetime we will encounter a plethora of opportunities to make someone smile; to lift someone up; to help a friend improve. Being a part of a team is a lot more than just showing up to practice with a bunch of familiar faces—you become a family, and as a teammate you always want to help others grow, because you want your teammates to be the best they can be. With that being said, critiques are a huge part of being a dancer, and the way we word things to our teammates can make a difference.</p>
          <p>Sandwiching comments is always a safe start when it comes to critiquing your teammates. Instead of heading right to the things they need to work on, say something they did amazing, then add a critique, then sandwich it with another thing you admired about their performance. My granny used to say, it’s not you say, it’s you say it. There is a way to get a point across without demeaning anyone or appearing like you are talking down to them.</p>
          <p>Example: “You did a really good job hitting that turn section, but I know you are strong enough to push it harder. Keep showing that beautiful smile!”</p>
          <p>The way we speak to each other is not only important in practice, but it is extremely crucial during important dance moments, such as before you go on the floor for Nationals. Before a performance, rather than just saying to focus on everything you need to improve on, you can think about how great you are going to do everything—Avoid saying things like “you better hit it” or “don’t fall out of the turn section” or “don’t mess up.” Improving the way you word things is only a subtle change in how you approach your team, but it could be more important than you realize.</p>
          <p>A positive way to focus your team is to have them sit down, close their eyes, play the music, and have them listen and think about doing the routine the they could ever imagine doing it—if their thought process has been directed to a positive before they hit the stage, it increases the likelihood of them achieving what they imagined. If their thought process has been directed to a negative right before approaching the stage, then that’s exactly what they’re focusing on, and they are more likely to make that mistake they were trying so hard to avoid.</p>
          <p>It’s easy to stick to what you know and live in a monotonous cycle: wake up; go to school; go to practice; go to sleep; repeat, and, somewhere in the mix, find something to eat. Finding the joys of our everyday life has become somewhat of a challenge because it requires extra thought into our routine; but I challenge you: wake up with a smile, meet someone new, approach practice with a different mindset and encourage your teammates to do the same. A positive mindset forces your outlook on life to be brighter, resulting in a happier, healthier and more rewarding lifestyle.</p>
