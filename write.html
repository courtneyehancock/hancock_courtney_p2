          <h3>Helmet World Record</h3>
          <h4>Published to the Independent Florida Alligator on November 26, 2017</h4>

          <p>UF students and Gator fans will attempt to break the world record of the largest gathering of people wearing helmets at the Gators men’s basketball game Today, International Guinness World Records Day, to promote scooter and bicycling safety on campus.</p>

          <p>The number to beat is 3,929.</p>
          <p>The game will be against the University of North Florida at the Exactech Arena at Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Start time is 7 p.m.</p>
          <p>The official attempt to break the record will be right before tipoff, after an announcement that will ask all fans to put on their helmets for five minutes.</p>
          <p>Breaking a world record is just a fun promotion that will hopefully catch the attention of the student body, according to Assistant Athletic Director of Marketing & Promotions Alicia Longworth, adviser to the Rowdy Reptiles, the men’s basketball student group.</p>
          <p>Longworth assisted in the execution process of the promotion. She said they have partnered with Florida Pedestrian and Bicycling Safety Resource Center who has provided 1,000 helmets that will be given out to students at Gate 3.</p>
          <p>They will be giving a scooter to one lucky student, she said, as well as giving away 10 Gator helmets.</p>
          <p>All fans attending the game are encouraged to bring their own helmet.</p>
          <p>Stephen Glancy, a senior UAA marketing intern and Rowdy Reptile, came up with the idea to bring attention to scooter and bike safety, as it is huge for the UF campus and Gainesville community.</p>
          <p>“It was really the perfect record for UF with scooters and bikes being so popular and the issue of students not wearing helmets being so prevalent,” he said.</p>
          <p>The actual world record attempt itself had to get approved after applying on the website, he said.</p>
          <p>“There will be two independent witnesses overseeing the attempt and the counting process,” he said. “There will be one steward for every 50 people to confirm their participation in the attempt.”</p>
          <p>Leading up to the game there will be videos sent out from the official team account promoting the event and scooter and bike safety, as well as a PSA from Gainesville PD, he said.</p>
          <p>The original record was achieved by Ministry of Interior at Baniyas stadium, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Mar. 13, 2016, according to the Guinness World Records website.</p>
          <p>UFPD Officer John Savona assisted in the process by helping the UAA Marketing Department get in touch with New Scooters 4 Less, which UFPD has partnered up with to promote scooter safety.</p>
          <p>Savona will be assisting the Florida Pedestrian and Bicycling Safety Resource Center to fit helmets today, he said.</p>
          <p>“The issue is very important to me because when riders are not wearing a helmet, whether it be on a bike or a scooter, and they get into an accident, usually the outcome is not good,” he said.</p>
          <p>Students are aware of what a helmet can do to protect them, but until something happens to them it isn’t reality, he said. That’s the problem with a lot of these scooter riders; they have helmets, but don’t wear them.</p>
          <p>Savona said he believes this event will help continue to remind students of the importance of wearing helmets and scooter and bicycling safety.</p>
          <p>“I would hope that they receive the message of the importance of helmet safety and encourage each other to wear them.”</p>
